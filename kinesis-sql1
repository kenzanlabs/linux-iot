-- STREAM (in-application): a continuously updated entity that you can SELECT from and INSERT into like a TABLE
-- PUMP: an entity used to continuously 'SELECT ... FROM' a source STREAM, and INSERT SQL results into an output STREAM
-- Create output stream, which can be used to send to a destination
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM" (mode2Process INTEGER);
-- Create pump to insert into output
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP "STREAM_PUMP" AS INSERT INTO "DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM"
-- Select all columns from source stream
SELECT STREAM mode2Process
FROM "IoTInput_001"
-- LIKE compares a string to a string pattern (_ matches all char, % matches substring)
-- SIMILAR TO compares string to a regex, may use ESCAPE
